          <h2>Inspiration</h2>
          <p>The inspiration for Virtual Doctor stemmed from witnessing firsthand the struggles many people face due to a lack of accessible medical care. Growing up, I saw numerous individuals in rural areas and small towns suffer because they couldn't easily reach a doctor. Many had to travel long distances to cities where medical facilities were more abundant, often enduring considerable physical and financial hardship just to get basic medical advice.

            Seeing the elderly and those with chronic conditions struggle the most, I was motivated to create a solution that could bring healthcare to their fingertips, regardless of their location. This personal experience highlighted the disparity in healthcare access and the urgent need for a tool that could bridge this gap.

          <p>This project began as a personal endeavor to blend medical knowledge with technology, starting in April 2024. It has since evolved into a comprehensive platform for virtual consultations and health management.</p>
